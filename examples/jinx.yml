//This file is consumed by the `-j` cli option.

//ContainerName: The name of a container for commands to operate on. Note that jinx does not internally track container
//  container names, so if your config file `somefile.yml` contains a custom container name and you run 
//  `jinx serve start -j somefile.yml`, then when you run `jinx serve stop` you should also supply `-j somefile.yml` 
//  so that the stop command stops the right container.
ContainerName: "jinkies"
//PullImages: true - jinx will reach out to docker hub to download the image you're operating on.
//PullImages: false - jinx will not reach out to docker hub. This is primarily for when you are developing an image and
//  want to use jinx with that image, but is appropriate for any situation where you do not want to download images.
PullImages: false
